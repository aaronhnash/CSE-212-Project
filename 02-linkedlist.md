# **Linked Lists**

## Introduction

### ***What is a linked list?***
A collection of points of data (nodes), “tied” together through references
### ***How does that work?***
You start at the front of the list, tell each data point what point is in front of it and what point is behind it. Also, nodes.

## Nodes
### ***What is a node?***
Earlier, I mentioned "a point of data." Really, though, I was describing a node.
### ***Moving from one node to another***
node.next & node.prev

## Popping & Pushing
What does that mean?
### Tying it together with a stack
